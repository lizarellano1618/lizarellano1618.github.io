  <h2> Computing Applications</h2>

	<p> I am using this site to show my repository for my Computing Applications class. The purpose is to be able to practice creating
 a website in the near future. Although I have a lot to still understand, I am hoping to get in more practice before moving forward. I 
 have many goals I still need to accomplish.
	</p>	

    <p> One of the goals I have is to become very knowledgeable in Computing Applications. At the moment, I am not sure
 what career path I am going to end up in. I believe Computing Applications will help me narrow down what career path I am going to take. I am 
 hoping that by taking this course, it will help guide me getting there.
    </p>

    <p> In my future career I aim to work as a professional for the current company that I work for now. I hope to stay within the same company since
I do believe that it is a great company. All I would need to do is change departments to work in IT instead of being a Patient Account Representative. 
There is someone who has already done that and is thriving, and I am hoping to do the same.</p>


    <p> Some of the hobbies and interests I have are: </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Spending time with my family and/or friends.</li>
          <li>Going to live events or sports.</li>
          <li>Playing video games.</li>
      </ul>
