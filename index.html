<h2>Computing Applications
</h2> 
<p>I am using this site to show my repository for my Computing Applications class.
</p> 
<p>One of the goals I have is to become very knowledgeable in Computing Applications. At the moment, I am not sure what career path I am going to end up in. 
  I believe Computing Applications will help me narrow down what career path I am going to take. I am hoping that by taking this course, it will help guide me getting there.
</p> 
 <p>In my future career I aim to work as a professional for the current company that I work for now. I hope to stay within the same company since I do believe that it is a great company. 
  All I would need to do is change departments to work in IT instead of being a Patient Account Representative. 
  There is someone who has already done that and is thriving, and I am hoping to do the same.
